# sensor-drivers
Collective repo for various sensor drivers that I used. Written in C. Tested on STM32F103RB.

`/spi/` directory contains basic SPI HAL functions that drives use. It shall be added to existing SPI configuration files.

All files have been written by me, but as this [meme](https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aGzpE0X_700bwp.webp) sums up, they were heavily inspired by another sources.
